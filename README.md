# Goal Scheduler

Goal Scheduler is a simple web application using Spring that allows for its users to plan group projects. Users can register as either a 'Leader' or as a simple member. Only Leaders are allowed to create new 'goals'. Goals are meant to be smaller tasks that allow the group to complete their bigger project and users are able to edit and remove these goals when needed.

Once at least one goal is set, users are able to list out their available times to complete these goals, which will be visible to the entire team. From there, users can schedule meetings and times to complete the goal in their own time.

Users are able to reset the app whenever they have a new project, allowing for a new leader and goals to be set.
